title: HttpRoute
---

HttpRoute defines the route to your service.

For example, a route to your wordpress service would be look as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.kalm.dev/v1alpha1
kind: HttpRoute
metadata:
  name: http-route-pnkx7ew16
spec:
  destinations:
    - host: wordpress.wordpress-showcase.svc.cluster.local:80
      weight: 1
  hosts:
    - wp.kalm-demo.clusters.kalm-apps.com
  methods:
    - GET
    - POST
    - PUT
    - PATCH
    - DELETE
    - HEAD
    - OPTIONS
    - CONNECT
    - TRACE
  paths:
    - /
  retries:
    attempts: 3
    perTtyTimeoutSeconds: 2
    retryOn:
      - gateway-error
      - connect-failure
      - refused-stream
  schemes:
    - http
    - https
  timeout: 5
```

We define this HttpRoute to route traffic to our component named `wordpress` in app: `wordpress-showcase`:

```yaml
spec:
  ...
  destinations:
    - host: wordpress.wordpress-showcase.svc.cluster.local:80
      weight: 1
```

We host the service at domain: `wp.kalm-demo.clusters.kalm-apps.com`.

```yaml
hosts:
  - wp.kalm-demo.clusters.kalm-apps.com
```

The HTTP methods we accept are:

```yaml
methods:
  - GET
  - POST
  - PUT
  - PATCH
  - DELETE
  - HEAD
  - OPTIONS
  - CONNECT
  - TRAC
```

We serve the service at root path: `/`.

```yaml
paths:
  - /
```

We define retry behaviors to make the service more robust:

```yaml
retries:
  attempts: 3
  perTtyTimeoutSeconds: 2
  retryOn:
    - gateway-error
    - connect-failure
    - refused-stream
```

We accept both `HTTPS` and `HTTP`:

```yaml
schemes:
  - http
  - https
```

We define timeout as 5 seconds:

```yaml
timeout: 5
```
