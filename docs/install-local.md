title: "Install Kalm On Local"
---

If you want to install kalm locally on a single node kubernetes, you can install it on minikube / k3s / kind.

The installation process is a bit different on each of the three hair versions of kubernetes, so we provide different tutorials, please click the kubernetes tutorial for the distribution you are using.

- [minikube](install-local-minikube)
- [k3s](install-local-k3s)
- [kind](install-local-kind)

All tutorial has been tested on Mac OS Big Sur version 11.2.1.
