title: "Install Kalm on a Local Cluster"
---

One way to test Kalm out is to install Kalm locally on a single node Kubernetes cluster. For convenience, we've provided some guides to help you install Kalm on minikube, k3s, and Kind.

The installation process is a bit different on each of the three versions of Kubernetes. Check out our installation tutorial for the distribution you are using!

- [minikube](install-local-minikube)
- [k3s](install-local-k3s)
- [kind](install-local-kind)

All tutorials has been tested on Mac OS Big Sur version 11.2.1.
